## Description
This application is used to record the team members who are working on a particular application, then displaying their information on a web page. This is done by taking the user through a series of questions about the team manager and however many engineers and/or interns also work on the application. Once all team members have been added, the results are displayed on the web page.
## Installation
This application requires the installation of the Inquirer package, Jest package, and Express.js
## Usage
The packages above are used, as well as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and test.js files to test the code. Each employee type is run through a test file to ensure the data received by the node.js commands match what the app is looking for. 
## Contributing
Contributions welcome to the HTML deployment and styling.
## Tests
User runs node index.js to first be prompted by questions about who the manager is, their employee ID, email address, and office number. Once done with these prompts, the user has the choice to add an engineer, an intern, or complete the team. If the user choses to add an engineer or intern, they are prompted with asking the next employee's name, ID, and email address. The fourth question depends on the individuals role as engineers need to enter their Github username and interns need to enter which school they attend. The user can enter as many engineers/interns as applicable. Once there are no more to add, the user choses to complete the team. Once this is selected, the HTML file is rendered that displays each of the team members and their information.  <br>
